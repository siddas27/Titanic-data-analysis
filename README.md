## Variable Notes

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br>
1st = Upper<br>
2nd = Middle<br>
3rd = Lower<br>

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5<br>

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br>
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister<br>
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)<br>

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br>
Parent = mother, father<br>
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson<br>
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
